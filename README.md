### This is a test project for Front-End Test Automation July 2024 Course @ SoftUni

This repository provides a detailed guide to implementing the Page Object Model (POM) pattern in Selenium WebDriver using C#. The goal is to automate key aspects of a web application using POM, focusing on the Swag Labs demo e-commerce platform.

## Application Overview
**Swag Labs** is a demo e-commerce platform built to allow QA engineers to practice automation testing. It features:
- A **Login page** to authenticate users.
- An **Inventory page** that displays available products.
- A **Shopping cart** where users can manage selected products.
- A **Checkout process** to complete purchases.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to:
- Implement the **Page Object Model (POM)** in a structured and scalable way.
- Automate the complete shopping process from login to checkout using **Selenium WebDriver**.
- Utilize waits, handle alerts, work with iFrames, and manage complex user interactions.
